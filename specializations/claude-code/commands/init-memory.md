description: Initialize the AI Memory Kit for the current repo. Creates .claude/team-state.md (tracked in git) and .claude/personal-state.md (gitignored), ensures correct .gitignore entries, appends session protocol to CLAUDE.md, and registers the repo in the global index. Safe to run multiple times (idempotent).

# Initialize Memory System for Current Repo

Run these steps in order. Skip any step that's already done (this command is idempotent).

## Step 1: Detect Context

- Determine the current working directory
- Check if it's a git repo (`ls .git` or `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)
- Read `~/.claude/global-state.md` to check if this repo is already registered

## Step 2: Create state files (if missing)

This repo uses TWO state files with different visibility:

**`.claude/team-state.md`** — committed to git (shared team context)

If `.claude/team-state.md` does not exist, create it:

```markdown
# [Repo Name] — Team State

Last updated: [today's date]

## Architecture & Key Decisions
<!-- Decisions the whole team should know. Include the "why" not just the "what". -->

## Conventions
<!-- Patterns, naming, tooling choices that apply across the team. -->

## Current Sprint Focus
<!-- Team-level "what are we working on right now" -->

## Shared Gotchas
<!-- Hard-won lessons. What surprised us. What NOT to do. -->
```

**`.claude/personal-state.md`** — gitignored (your personal context)

If `.claude/personal-state.md` does not exist, create it:

```markdown
# [Repo Name] — Personal State

Last updated: [today's date]

(This file is gitignored. It's yours — context you wouldn't want teammates reading as objective fact.)

## My Current Focus
<!-- Your personal next steps -->

## Personal Context
<!-- Working notes, opinions, relationship dynamics for this repo -->

## What I'm Watching
<!-- Open questions, things to follow up on -->
```

## Step 3: Fix `.gitignore`

Check `.gitignore`. Ensure these lines are present:

```
.claude/personal-state.md
.claude/settings.local.json
.claude/memory.db
```

**Do NOT add `.claude/` as a whole directory.** That breaks skills and commands. Only add the specific files above. Note that `team-state.md` is intentionally NOT gitignored — it is meant to be committed and shared with your team.

If any of those lines are missing, append them. If `.claude/` (as a directory) is already in `.gitignore`, remove it and replace with the three file-level entries above.

## Step 4: Append Session Protocol to CLAUDE.md

Read the repo's `CLAUDE.md`. If it does NOT already contain "Session State Protocol", append this:

```markdown

## Session State Protocol

**At session start (REQUIRED):**
1. Read `~/.claude/global-state.md` — preferences, active projects, memory file manifest
2. Read `.claude/team-state.md` in this repo — shared team context: architecture decisions, conventions, sprint focus, gotchas
3. Read `.claude/personal-state.md` in this repo — your personal context: current focus, working notes, opinions
4. Check the Memory Files table in global-state.md — load any `~/.claude/memory/` files relevant to this session's topic

**At session end (when user says stop/done/pause/tomorrow):**
1. Update `.claude/team-state.md` with shared context: architecture decisions, conventions, gotchas the team should know
2. Update `.claude/personal-state.md` with personal context: your next steps, working notes, opinions
3. Update the project's row in `~/.claude/global-state.md` Active Projects table
4. If significant new cross-repo context was created (patterns, strategies, decisions), create or update a file in `~/.claude/memory/` and add it to the Memory Files manifest in global-state.md

**Do NOT use ruvector/claude-flow memory CLI for state storage.** Use plain markdown files only.
```

If `CLAUDE.md` doesn't exist, create a minimal one with the repo name as a heading and the block above.

## Step 5: Register in Global Index

Read `~/.claude/global-state.md`. If the current repo is NOT in the Active Projects table, add a row:

```
| [Project Name] | [full repo path] | New — just initialized | TBD |
```

Add the repo's state files to the State Files table if missing:

```
| `[full path]/.claude/team-state.md` | Shared team context for this repo |
| `[full path]/.claude/personal-state.md` | Personal context for this repo (gitignored) |
```

## Step 6: Report

Tell the user:
- `.claude/team-state.md` — created or already existed (committed to git, shared with team)
- `.claude/personal-state.md` — created or already existed (gitignored, personal only)
- `.gitignore` — updated or already correct
- `CLAUDE.md` — protocol appended or already present
- `global-state.md` — repo registered or already listed
