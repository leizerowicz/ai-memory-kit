# Global State — Index

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Preferences

### Working style
- [Communication tone — e.g. "direct, no filler, skip pleasantries"]
- [Draft preference — e.g. "draft all external comms to me first; flag what to leave OUT"]
- [Review step — e.g. "I review important comms with [name] before sending — always include that step"]

### Technical preferences
- [Tool/language defaults — e.g. "always TypeScript strict mode"]
- [Commit style — e.g. "imperative mood, explain why not what"]
- [Build/deploy habits — e.g. "never touch production before local repro"]

### Team context
<!--
This section is where the real leverage lives. Record relationship dynamics so the AI
handles people correctly without being re-briefed every session. Examples:

- "Sarah (Design): prefers async feedback via Figma, not Slack. 24h heads-up for scope changes."
- "Jordan (co-founder): peer, not a report. Keep informed; Jordan manages their own workload."
- "Engineering team: mostly PST, decisions async in Notion."
-->
- [Name (role): key dynamic, communication preference, anything the AI should know]

### Decision frameworks
<!--
Record how you actually think about recurring decision types. Examples:

- "Pricing questions: always segment paid vs. free before drawing conclusions."
- "Build vs. buy: default buy for non-core infra unless vendor creates lock-in risk."
- "Vendor disputes: frame in writing first, negotiate specifics live."
-->
- [Decision type: your default approach or framework]

## Active Projects

| Project | Repo | Status | Next |
|---------|------|--------|------|
| Example Project | ~/repos/org/repo | Brief current status | Concrete next action |

## Memory Files (load on demand)

Load these from `~/.ai-memory/memory/` when the session topic matches:

| File | When to load | Summary |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `example-topic.md` | Keywords that trigger loading | One-line summary of what's inside |

## State Files (per-repo)

| Location | Covers |
|----------|--------|
| `~/.ai-memory/state.md` | Admin work, non-repo tasks |
| `~/repos/org/repo/.ai-memory/state.md` | What this repo is about |

## Session Protocol

**Start:**
1. Read this file + the repo's `.ai-memory/state.md`
2. Check Memory Files table — load any that match this session's topic
3. Summarize current state, then ask: **"What's the goal for this session? What does success look like?"**

**Mid-session drift check:** If work diverges from the stated goal, flag it gently and ask whether to stay the course or pivot.

**End (on "stop" / "done" / "pause" / "tomorrow"):**
1. Update this file's Active Projects row for the current repo
2. Update the repo's `.ai-memory/state.md`
3. Create/update topic memory files for any significant new cross-repo context
4. Append to `~/.ai-memory/memory/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
5. Confirm: **"State saved. Say 'let's continue' next time."**
